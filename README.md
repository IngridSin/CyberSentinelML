CyberSentinelML

CyberSentinelML is a machine learning-based intrusion detection system (IDS) designed to detect and classify malicious network attacks in real-time. Using advanced ML models, it analyzes network traffic patterns to identify threats such as DDoS, port scanning, malware communication, and unauthorized access attempts.

In addition to network security, CyberSentinelML now includes spam and phishing email detection, leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and anomaly detection algorithms to identify fraudulent emails, phishing attempts, and malicious attachments. This enhancement strengthens overall cyber defense by protecting both network infrastructure and email communication from cyber threats.
